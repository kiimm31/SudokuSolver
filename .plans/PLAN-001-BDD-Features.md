# BDD Feature Specifications for Sudoku Solver Refactoring

## Feature 1: Immutable Cell Model

### Scenario 1.1: Cell Creation with Valid Values
```gherkin
Feature: Cell Model Immutability
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want cells to be immutable records
  So that the code is more predictable and thread-safe

  Scenario: Create cell with valid values
    Given I want to create a cell at position (3, 4)
    When I create a cell with value 7
    Then the cell should have Row = 3
    And the cell should have Column = 4
    And the cell should have Value = 7
    And the cell should be immutable
```

### Scenario 1.2: Cell Value Validation
```gherkin
  Scenario: Create cell with invalid values
    Given I want to create a cell at position (1, 1)
    When I try to create a cell with value -1
    Then an ArgumentOutOfRangeException should be thrown
    And the exception message should contain "Value must be between 0 and 9"
    
    When I try to create a cell with value 10
    Then an ArgumentOutOfRangeException should be thrown
    And the exception message should contain "Value must be between 0 and 9"
```

### Scenario 1.3: Cell Value Updates
```gherkin
  Scenario: Update cell value immutably
    Given I have a cell at position (2, 3) with value 0
    When I call WithValue(5) on the cell
    Then a new cell should be returned
    And the new cell should have Value = 5
    And the original cell should remain unchanged
    And the new cell should have the same Row and Column
```

### Scenario 1.4: Possible Values Management
```gherkin
  Scenario: Eliminate possible values
    Given I have a cell at position (1, 1) with possible values [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    When I eliminate possible value 3
    Then the cell should have possible values [1,2,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    And the cell should not be solved
    And the cell should not be confirmed
    
    When I eliminate all values except 7
    Then the cell should have possible values [7]
    And the cell should be confirmed
    And the cell should not be solved
```

## Feature 2: Optimized Grid Model

### Scenario 2.1: Efficient Cell Access
```gherkin
Feature: Grid Performance Optimization
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want O(1) cell access performance
  So that the solver runs efficiently

  Scenario: Fast cell lookup
    Given I have a 9x9 Sudoku grid
    When I access cell at position (5, 6)
    Then the cell should be returned in O(1) time
    And the cell should have Row = 5 and Column = 6
```

### Scenario 2.2: Row Retrieval
```gherkin
  Scenario: Get all cells in a row
    Given I have a 9x9 Sudoku grid
    When I get row 3
    Then I should get 9 cells
    And all cells should have Row = 3
    And the cells should be ordered by Column (1 to 9)
    And the operation should be optimized with caching
```

### Scenario 2.3: Column Retrieval
```gherkin
  Scenario: Get all cells in a column
    Given I have a 9x9 Sudoku grid
    When I get column 4
    Then I should get 9 cells
    And all cells should have Column = 4
    And the cells should be ordered by Row (1 to 9)
    And the operation should be optimized with caching
```

### Scenario 2.4: Box Retrieval
```gherkin
  Scenario: Get all cells in a 3x3 box
    Given I have a 9x9 Sudoku grid
    When I get the box containing cell (4, 5)
    Then I should get 9 cells
    And all cells should be in the same 3x3 box
    And the cells should include positions (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)
```

## Feature 3: Constraint System Refactoring

### Scenario 3.1: Constraint Validation
```gherkin
Feature: Constraint System Interface
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want a clean constraint interface
  So that constraints are easy to implement and test

  Scenario: Validate row constraint
    Given I have a grid with a row containing [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    When I validate the row constraint
    Then the constraint should be valid
    
    Given I have a grid with a row containing [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,1]
    When I validate the row constraint
    Then the constraint should be invalid
    And the violation should be reported
```

### Scenario 3.2: Constraint Application
```gherkin
  Scenario: Apply constraint to eliminate values
    Given I have a cell with possible values [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
    And there are solved cells in the same row with values [1,3,5,7,9]
    When I apply the row constraint
    Then the cell should have possible values [2,4,6,8]
    And the constraint should return the updated grid
```

### Scenario 3.3: Constraint Composition
```gherkin
  Scenario: Apply multiple constraints
    Given I have a grid with multiple unsolved cells
    When I apply all constraints (row, column, box)
    Then all constraints should be applied
    And the grid should be updated accordingly
    And any violations should be reported
```

## Feature 4: Strategy Pattern Improvements

### Scenario 4.1: Strategy Prioritization
```gherkin
Feature: Strategy Execution Order
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want strategies to be executed in priority order
  So that the most effective strategies run first

  Scenario: Execute strategies by priority
    Given I have strategies with priorities [HiddenSingles=1, NakedSubsets=2, Pointing=3]
    When I execute all strategies
    Then HiddenSingles should execute first
    And NakedSubsets should execute second
    And Pointing should execute third
```

### Scenario 4.2: Strategy Applicability
```gherkin
  Scenario: Check if strategy can be applied
    Given I have a grid with some unsolved cells
    When I check if HiddenSingles strategy can be applied
    Then the strategy should return true if applicable
    And the strategy should return false if not applicable
```

### Scenario 4.3: Strategy Results Tracking
```gherkin
  Scenario: Track strategy execution results
    Given I have a grid with unsolved cells
    When I execute the HiddenSingles strategy
    Then the strategy should return affected cells
    And the number of cells affected should be tracked
    And the execution time should be measured
```

## Feature 5: Dependency Injection

### Scenario 5.1: Service Registration
```gherkin
Feature: Dependency Injection Setup
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want services to be registered in a DI container
  So that dependencies are properly managed

  Scenario: Register core services
    Given I have a service collection
    When I register Sudoku services
    Then ISudokuSolver should be registered as scoped
    And IConstraintValidator should be registered as scoped
    And IStrategyExecutor should be registered as scoped
    And IProgressTracker should be registered as scoped
```

### Scenario 5.2: Service Resolution
```gherkin
  Scenario: Resolve services from container
    Given I have a configured service provider
    When I resolve ISudokuSolver
    Then a ClassicSudokuSolverService should be returned
    And all its dependencies should be injected
    And the service should be ready to use
```

## Feature 6: Logging and Monitoring

### Scenario 6.1: Solving Process Logging
```gherkin
Feature: Structured Logging
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want comprehensive logging of the solving process
  So that I can debug and monitor performance

  Scenario: Log solving start
    Given I have a grid with 45 unsolved cells
    When I start solving the grid
    Then a log entry should be created with level Information
    And the log should contain "Starting Sudoku solving"
    And the log should contain the unsolved cell count
```

### Scenario 6.2: Strategy Application Logging
```gherkin
  Scenario: Log strategy application
    Given I have a grid being solved
    When the HiddenSingles strategy is applied
    Then a log entry should be created
    And the log should contain the strategy name
    And the log should contain the number of cells affected
    And the log should contain the execution time
```

### Scenario 6.3: Constraint Violation Logging
```gherkin
  Scenario: Log constraint violations
    Given I have a grid with a constraint violation
    When the violation is detected
    Then a log entry should be created with level Warning
    And the log should contain the constraint name
    And the log should contain the violation details
    And the log should contain the grid state
```

## Feature 7: Configuration Management

### Scenario 7.1: Load Configuration
```gherkin
Feature: Configuration Management
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want configurable solver parameters
  So that the solver can be tuned for different scenarios

  Scenario: Load solver configuration
    Given I have a configuration file with solver settings
    When I load the configuration
    Then MaxIterations should be set to 100
    And TimeoutSeconds should be set to 30
    And EnableLogging should be set to true
    And LogLevel should be set to Information
```

### Scenario 7.2: Strategy Configuration
```gherkin
  Scenario: Configure strategy settings
    Given I have a configuration file with strategy settings
    When I load the configuration
    Then HiddenSingles strategy should be enabled
    And HiddenSingles priority should be 1
    And NakedSubsets strategy should be enabled
    And NakedSubsets priority should be 2
```

## Feature 8: Performance Optimization

### Scenario 8.1: Caching Implementation
```gherkin
Feature: Performance Optimization
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want optimized performance
  So that puzzles are solved quickly

  Scenario: Cache row/column/box collections
    Given I have a grid with frequently accessed rows
    When I access the same row multiple times
    Then the first access should populate the cache
    And subsequent accesses should use cached data
    And the performance should be improved
```

### Scenario 8.2: Memory Management
```gherkin
  Scenario: Optimize memory usage
    Given I have a grid being solved
    When the solving process creates many intermediate objects
    Then object pooling should be used for frequently created objects
    And memory usage should be optimized
    And garbage collection pressure should be reduced
```

## Feature 9: Test Coverage Enhancement

### Scenario 9.1: Integration Testing
```gherkin
Feature: Comprehensive Testing
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want 80%+ test coverage
  So that the code is reliable and maintainable

  Scenario: Test complete solving workflow
    Given I have a valid Sudoku puzzle
    When I run the complete solving process
    Then all constraints should be applied correctly
    And all strategies should be executed in order
    And the puzzle should be solved correctly
    And the process should be logged appropriately
```

### Scenario 9.2: Performance Testing
```gherkin
  Scenario: Test solving performance
    Given I have puzzles of different difficulty levels
    When I solve each puzzle
    Then the solving time should be measured
    And the memory usage should be tracked
    And the performance should meet benchmarks
    And the results should be reported
```

### Scenario 9.3: Edge Case Testing
```gherkin
  Scenario: Test edge cases
    Given I have an invalid Sudoku grid
    When I try to solve the grid
    Then appropriate exceptions should be thrown
    And the exceptions should be handled gracefully
    And meaningful error messages should be provided
    
    Given I have an unsolvable Sudoku grid
    When I try to solve the grid
    Then the solver should detect it's unsolvable
    And the solver should stop after maximum iterations
    And the partial solution should be returned
```

## Feature 10: Error Handling and Recovery

### Scenario 10.1: Graceful Error Handling
```gherkin
Feature: Robust Error Handling
  As a Sudoku solver developer
  I want robust error handling
  So that the solver is reliable in all scenarios

  Scenario: Handle constraint violations gracefully
    Given I have a grid with a constraint violation
    When the violation is detected during solving
    Then the violation should be logged
    And the solving process should be stopped
    And a meaningful error should be returned
    And the partial solution should be preserved
```

### Scenario 10.2: Recovery from Errors
```gherkin
  Scenario: Recover from strategy failures
    Given I have a grid being solved
    When a strategy fails to apply correctly
    Then the strategy should be reverted
