# PLAN-002: Advanced Sudoku Solving Strategies Expansion

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the comprehensive expansion of the `ISolvingStrategy` interface to include advanced Sudoku solving techniques that will significantly improve the solving capabilities of the `ClassicSudokuSolver`. The expansion will introduce sophisticated strategies like X-wing, Y-wing, Swordfish, Jellyfish, and other advanced techniques to handle complex Sudoku puzzles that cannot be solved with basic strategies alone.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture
- **Base Strategy Pattern**: `BaseSolvingStrategy` provides common functionality for applying strategies to rows, columns, and boxes
- **Cell Management**: `Cell` class with `PossibleValues` list and elimination capabilities
- **Grid Operations**: Comprehensive grid operations for rows, columns, and boxes
- **Current Strategies**: Hidden Singles, Naked Subsets, Pointing Strategy
- **Solver Integration**: `ClassicSudokuSolver` with strategy prioritization and iteration

### Current Limitations
- Limited to basic and intermediate solving techniques
- Cannot handle complex puzzles requiring advanced strategies
- No support for cross-unit pattern recognition
- Missing advanced elimination techniques

  So that I can solve puzzles with X-Wing patterns

  Scenario: Detect and apply X-Wing pattern
    Given a Sudoku grid with an X-Wing pattern for candidate 5
    When I apply the X-Wing strategy
    Then the candidate 5 should be eliminated from non-intersecting cells
    And the pattern should be correctly identified
    And the elimination should be safe and valid

  Scenario: No X-Wing pattern found
    Given a Sudoku grid without X-Wing patterns
    When I apply the X-Wing strategy
    Then no eliminations should be made
    And the strategy should report no patterns found
```
