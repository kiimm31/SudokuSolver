## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) feature specifications for all advanced Sudoku solving strategies. Each feature includes detailed scenarios, acceptance criteria, and test data requirements to ensure proper implementation and validation.

## Feature 1: X-Wing Strategy

### Feature Description
As a Sudoku solver, I want to use X-Wing strategy so that I can solve puzzles with X-Wing patterns where a candidate appears exactly twice in two rows and in the same two columns.

### Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Basic X-Wing Pattern Detection
```gherkin
Feature: X-Wing Strategy - Basic Pattern Detection
  As a Sudoku solver
  I want to detect X-Wing patterns
  So that I can identify elimination opportunities

  Scenario: Detect X-Wing pattern in rows
    Given a Sudoku grid with candidate 5 appearing exactly twice in rows 1 and 3
    And the candidate 5 appears in the same two columns (2 and 7) in both rows
    When I apply the X-Wing strategy
    Then the X-Wing pattern should be correctly identified
    And the pattern should include rows 1 and 3
    And the pattern should include columns 2 and 7
    And the candidate 5 should be eliminated from other cells in columns 2 and 7
    And the elimination should be safe and valid

  Scenario: Detect X-Wing pattern in columns
    Given a Sudoku grid with candidate 3 appearing exactly twice in columns 4 and 8
    And the candidate 3 appears in the same two rows (2 and 6) in both columns
    When I apply the X-Wing strategy
    Then the X-Wing pattern should be correctly identified
    And the pattern should include columns 4 and 8
    And the pattern should include rows 2 and 6
    And the candidate 3 should be eliminated from other cells in rows 2 and 6
    And the elimination should be safe and valid
```

#### Scenario 2: No X-Wing Pattern Found
```gherkin

    When I apply the X-Wing strategy
    Then no X-Wing patterns should be identified
    And no eliminations should be made
    And the strategy should report no patterns found
    And the grid should remain unchanged

  Scenario: Invalid X-Wing pattern (different columns)
    Given a Sudoku grid with candidate 7 appearing exactly twice in rows 1 and 4

    When I apply the X-Wing strategy
    Then no X-Wing patterns should be identified
    And no eliminations should be made
    And the strategy should report no valid patterns
```

#### Scenario 3: Multiple X-Wing Patterns
```gherkin
  Scenario: Multiple X-Wing patterns for different candidates

5. Strategies should implement proper error handling and timeout mechanisms

### Testing Implementation Guidelines
1. Unit tests should cover all strategy methods
2. Integration tests should verify strategy combinations
3. Performance tests should validate time limits
4. Edge case tests should cover boundary conditions
